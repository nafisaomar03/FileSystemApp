# FileSystemApp

FileSystemApp is a Java program that mimics the behavior of a basic file system using a tree data structure. The application represents folders and files in a hierarchical manner and demonstrates how directory traversal and navigation are handled in operating systems.

## Key Concepts
- Tree-based data structures
- Parent-child relationships
- Recursive traversal
- Exception-safe navigation

## Functionality
- Represents a root directory containing folders and files
- Supports moving between directories
- Performs recursive searches within the file system
- Displays the complete directory structure
- Simulates real-world file system behavior
